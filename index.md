#This is a test for me to figure out github pages
I'm not super familiar with Markdown so I need to make some test pages to learn it.

Like making a [link](https://duckduckgo.com).

##Smaller headings
They work just fine.

```Interesting that this doesn't show up
(code codey code code $(*#&(*lflkjnclnd
```

Test complete.
