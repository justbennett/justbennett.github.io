#March 19, 1950 - July 31, 2024

Houston-Bobby Hugh "B.H." Sanderson, 74, passed away Wednesday, July 31, 2024, at North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo. He was born March 19, 1950, in Houston, MS, to the late James Thad Sanderson and Melba Lois Berry Sanderson. He was a member of the First Baptist Church Houston, Jaycees, Mississippi Firefighters Association, Biloxi Rotary, various Ham radio groups, and a Houston Topper Pride Band Booster.

He is survived by his wife, Dorajean Bennett Sanderson of Houston; his daughter, Miriam Garner (Jesse Brand) of Houston; his son, Bennett Thad Sanderson (Jana Fenton) of Hattiesburg; eight grandkids, Sandy, Emma Lee, Brand and Thad Garner of Houston, Laurel, Fenton, Grisham and Houston Sanderson of Hattiesburg; his sister, Betty Sanderson Sandidge of Houston; one great-grandchild, Jesse Gill of Houston; one niece, Dr. Amanda Harris of Brandon; nephew, Todd Bennett of Houston.

He was preceded in death by his parents, Thad and Melba Sanderson, and a brother-in-law, Faber David Sandidge.

As a member of First Baptist Church, he was ordained at 22 years old, becoming the youngest deacon of the church. He served on many committees, served as the Sunday School superintendent, taught Sunday School, and ran the sound for 25 years while also being the narrator for various programs with his beautiful radio voice. 

As a Houston Volunteer Fire Department member since 1985, Captain Bobby Sanderson served as the fire chief, deputy chief, assistant chief, training officer, secretary, treasurer, and board member. During his 39 years of service, he received the Most Improved Firefighter, the Roy E. Gray Memorial Firefighter of the Year twice, and the Top Nozzle/Cold Sheets Awards nearly every year. He also served as the first Chickasaw County Emergency Coordinator. 

Other projects that Bobby has been a part of include the Houston Stadium Task Force, Houston Christmas Parade Chair, Flywheel Steering Committee, Houston Band Uniform Drive Chair, band bus driver, voice of the Topper Pride Band, Chickasaw Emergency Preparedness Task Force, and local Scouting Coordinator.

Over the years, he received various awards and recognitions, including Colonel to Governor Bill Waller, Governor’s Corp, MS Jaycees Outstanding Young Man of Houston, Outstanding Young Mississippian, Outstanding Young Firefighter, Junior Chamber International Senator, and 2010 Man of the Year in Houston. 

As an Extra Class ham radio operator (KA5ICO), Bobby made contacts with stations around the world. He was a member of the ARRL and worked with various ham radio networks in the area to help provide communication in emergency situations. He built lifelong friendships on the airwaves and enjoyed talking with fellow hams across the region. He also helped to establish the Sundancer Solar Radio Club to help provide communications for the Houston Solar Race Team. The club now operates as the Calhoun/Chickasaw Amateur Radio Club.

Bobby lived out his Christian faith by serving others. He believed in fulfilling every duty with diligence and excellence. He was known as the man who could solve any problem in his family, church, and community. Whether it be broken toys, a civic event to plan, a clock to restore, a tricky relationship, a complicated business deal, a philosophical question, or a life-threatening emergency - Bobby Sanderson was the man who so many depended on to make things right. He was endlessly curious, a good listener, a deep thinker, and a tireless doer. When asked by the newspaper about his community involvement, he said, “Some fish, hunt, or play golf. My hobby is service. I enjoy trying to make things better, happier, safer, and more prosperous for others.”

Above all, he loved his family. As a husband he marveled over how his and Dorajean’s love grew year after year. As a father, he tirelessly volunteered to drive the bus, work the concessions, build the project, or do whatever needed to be done to help his kids pursue their interests. He bragged about every success and was there to help his children recover from every setback. As “Popsie'' to his grandchildren and great-grandson, he bragged to anyone who would listen about their exceptional beauty, unbelievable talent, and unquestionable destiny of success in anything they tried.

Ultimately, Bobby showed us all what it means to follow Jesus by always putting others before himself. Now, after a life lived to the fullest, we can be comforted to know that Bobby, when he looks into the face of Jesus, will hear the words he longed for his whole life, “Well done, thy good and faithful servant.”
